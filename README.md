#### Ray tracing parameters (in `fshader.glsl`):
 - t_min = 0.1. The minimum `t` to solve for ray intersection with object. Larger than 0 to deal with shadow acne.
  - rayStrength. Times 0.7 after each bounce. The lower the darker the scene.
  - maxRayBounce = 10. Limit number of ray bounce.
#### Anti-aliasing parameters (in `RenderAttributes.h`):
- samples_per_pixel = 100
